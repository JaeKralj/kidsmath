# BASIC ARITHMETICS GAME FOR KIDS!
This game is created for kids who are just introduced to basic addition and subtraction, I built this game from scratch to learn basic javascript on my own.

### The Logic:
The game randomly generates two numbers between 1 and 10 and decides to either add or subtract them based on the value of the first number. if the first number is greater than the second number, the game subtracts else it adds the numbers.
For Each question the User has 3 attempts, user can't go back to previous question.

### Tools:
This game was built with HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.
My  niece uses this game to learn Basic Arithmetics.
